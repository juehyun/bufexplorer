# BufExplorer
- This repository is folked from "jlanzarotta/bufexplorer"
- Refer the original repository for detailed information

# Changes
- I used to open files in multiple split windows and multiple tabs, When I run BufExplorer and select buffer, I expect vim move me to the window which opened the buffer
	- Move to the tab is OK, but
	- Open the buffer unexpected split window
	- Change the 'SelectBuffer' function code to fix it

- Add "Esc" key to close BufExplorer
